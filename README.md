# RFM-Segmentation-EDA-on-superstore-sales-data
This project performs RFM Segmentation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Superstore Sales dataset using MySQL. The goal is to uncover key business insights, such as sales  recency, frequency, monetary, trends profitability, customer segmentation, and regional performance.

## Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis on a superstore sales dataset. The goal is to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and identify key customer groups such as loyal customers, new customers, and churned customers. The analysis is done using MySQL.

## 📌 Methodology  

The customer segmentation analysis was conducted using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** in **MySQL**. The methodology follows a structured approach:

### 🔹 1. Data Preparation  
- Loaded the `superstore_sales_data` dataset into MySQL.  
- Explored the dataset to ensure proper formatting using SQL queries.  
- Converted **order date** and **ship date** columns into the correct date format using `STR_TO_DATE()`.  

### 🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identified **top-selling products** by aggregating total sales.  
- Determined **most profitable products** by calculating total profit.  
- Analyzed **sales and profit trends** by product categories.  
- Examined **customer purchase frequency** and **total spending** to understand customer behavior.  

### 🔹 3. RFM Calculation  
- **Recency:** Calculated days since the last purchase for each customer.  
- **Frequency:** Counted total purchases made by each customer.  
- **Monetary Value:** Summed total revenue generated by each customer.  

### 🔹 4. RFM Scoring  
- Ranked customers into **4 segments** for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary using `NTILE(4)`.  
- Assigned **R, F, and M scores** ranging from **1 (low) to 4 (high)**.  
- Created a **combined RFM score** (e.g., `444` for best customers, `111` for least engaged customers).  

### 🔹 5. Customer Segmentation  
- Mapped RFM score combinations to meaningful customer segments:  
  - **💎 Loyal Customers** (High RFM scores)  
  - **✨ New Customers** (Recent purchases, low frequency)  
  - **📈 Active Customers** (Moderate engagement)  
  - **⚠️ Potential Churners** (Declining engagement)  
  - **🚨 Churned Customers** (No recent purchases)  
- Used **SQL CASE statements** to categorize customers into these groups.  

### 🔹 6. Business Insights & Recommendations  
- Summarized **customer distribution** across RFM segments.  
- Provided **marketing recommendations** for each segment:  
  - 🎯 **Retention strategies** for loyal customers.  
  - 🔄 **Re-engagement strategies** for potential churners.  
  - 📢 **Acquisition strategies** for new customers.
